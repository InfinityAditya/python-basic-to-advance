## 👋 Introduction & Who Is This For?

Welcome to the ultimate resource for self-paced Python mastery!

This repository is designed to take you on a structured journey through Python programming, starting with the absolute basics and progressing to advanced topics like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and decorators.

* **Beginners:** Start with `python_fundamental.ipynb` and follow the path sequentially.
* **Intermediate Learners:** Dive straight into the OOP and advanced concepts notebooks.

## 🤯 Make Learning Fun: Project-Based Practice

The best way to solidify your knowledge is to **build something crazy and fun!** Once you complete a module, try to implement the concept in a small project.

| Topic Covered | Fun Project Idea |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fundamentals, Loops, Dictionaries** | Build a **Simple CLI Quiz Game** or a **Contact Book** |
| **Functions & OOP** | Develop a **Basic Calculator Class** or a **Text-Based Adventure Game** |
| **Advanced OOP, Decorators** | Create a simple **Logging Decorator** that tracks when a function is called, or an **Animal Farm Simulator** using Inheritance. |
